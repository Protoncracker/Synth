## Towards Λήθη: The Book of Knowledge - The Memory Palace of Protoncracker

Welcome to **Synth**—the seed and first-draft concept for a greater vision: **Λήθη** (Lethe), a digital library that aspires to contain everything humanity knows, synthesized and accessible to all.

This project is my personal memory palace, a curated map of the digital world, and a living protest for the freedom of knowledge. Here, you'll find links and resources across the fields I know best—primarily Information Technology, Cybersecurity, Programming, and the deep realms of Occultism and Mythology.

### On Piracy, Ethics, and Access

I do **not** support piracy as a business or as a means for others to profit from the work of creators. I support the *spirit* of piracy as a protest against artificial barriers to knowledge. If you are poor, if you are struggling, if you are locked out of learning by circumstance—**you deserve access**.

But if you can afford to buy a book, a course, or a subscription, **please support the creators**. Buy, donate, and give back when you are able. The world is better when knowledge flows freely *and* when creators are rewarded for their work.

### The Vision

**Λήθη** is imagined as the ultimate digital library:  
A place where every piece of usable information can be found, synthesized, and freely accessed.  
For now, Synth is just the beginning—a collection of links, guides, and resources that I, Protoncracker, have gathered and organized.

### What You'll Find

- **Synth.md**: The heart of this repository. A massive, ever-growing document of links, guides, libraries, tools, and communities across computing, hacking, science, literature, and more. Think of it as a digital survival kit for the mind.
- **IT & Computing**: From basic skills to advanced cybersecurity, programming, Linux, and networking.
- **Occultism & Mythology**: A dedicated, organized section for esoteric knowledge, myth, and the mysteries of human culture.
- **No ads. No tracking. No agenda.** Just knowledge, as free as I can make it.

### Limitations & Growth

This is only what I can do for now—what I have, what I know, what I can reach.  
Λήθη is a dream; Synth is the reality I can build today.  
It does not (yet) contain everything I imagine, but it grows as I do.

### Structure

- Each major topic has its own `.md` file, referenced from [Synth.md](./Synth.md).
- The project is ordered for clarity and future expansion.
- Each section is a living document, meant to be updated and expanded as I learn and discover more.

### Who Is This For?

- The student who can't afford textbooks.
- The autodidact who wants to learn everything.
- The hacker, the builder, the dreamer, the lost, the found.
- Anyone who believes that **knowledge is a right, not a privilege**.
